# Employee-Tracker-App

Hello and welcome to the Employee Tracker Application!

This application was written and created by Andrew Gracia.

It was created with the purpose to easily view and update Employees, Departments, Roles, and Employee Roles.

The application must first have the database created and seated and have the MySql server running. 

It can be accessed through the terminal and starts with the "npm start" command.

[Here is a link to a video that shows how to create the database, seed it, and run the application!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XPxH1LtY70htfWhkFvNL8DrGHm6gRSMR/view)
